# guessing-game
 My first techdegree project, the number guessing game:

    In this game you will guess a number (in the range of 1-10) in aim of blindly guessing the same number that the program has generated. This is a randomized number, and therefore may be different in each play of the game. The point is to use the least number of attempts possible (1 attempt being the best).

    The game will keep track of the highscore ('best game' attempt), the average (mean) of all game scores, the most occuring number of attempts (mode), and the median of all the game attempt scores.

    Since the game begins with a menu, it will tell the user to choose one of three options. "Play," will take the user in to begin the game. "Help," will give the user the game instructions on how to play. "Exit," will end the program for the user (in the menu and inside the game).
